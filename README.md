Rice BIOE 421 Final Project

At-home Fitness Tracker
	We have developed a device that tracks at-home workouts by counting steps and timing the length of the workouts, and then using this information to allow the user to monitor their workouts over time. aUnlike many of the pedometers on the market today, ours is capable of storing the user’s fitness data over time and displaying this information as a chart on the computer. This allows the user to collect information from their pedometer in an easy-to-utilize way, which can help them with their fitness goals. Data logging can better inform the user’s fitness activity, and ensure that they are recognizing the times when they are falling short. Most of the pedometers with data logging capability that are on the market today are very costly, so our watch would fulfill the need for a cost-efficient fitness monitor to promote public health. Furthermore, our device is versatile in that it can be placed on either the arms or the legs based on the type of exercise or exercise equipment being used. We utilized circuit Playground in order to create our device.
	
Use cases:
- User does at home workouts (Insanity, P90X, BBG), and wants to know how their workout patterns are changing from day to day
- User has at-home workout equipment - treadmill, elliptical, stationary bike.

	
Future steps would include making this device portable and able to work outside of the home and without the use of a computer or wires.
