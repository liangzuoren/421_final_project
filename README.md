Rice BIOE 421 Final Project

Brainstorm
Smart Watch
http://www.tinkernut.com/portfolio/make-smartwatch-old-cell-phone-part-1/
We will design a portable watch, similar to that created by Tinkernut, but with some key
additions and modifications. The watch will be fashioned using an old smartphone and Arduino
Mini Pro. The watch is capable of telling time and connecting via Bluetooth to the user's
cellphone to pass on notifications from the cellphone to the watch. We hope to add a camera to the watch,
as well as a pedometer, and a heart rate sensor.

Use cases: We expect students on campus to use this as an easier way of getting phone notifications without
having to actually take out their phone, as well as a way of monitoring their exercise (steps per day 
as well as heart rate during strenuous exercise). This device would be cheaper than an AppleWatch
while performing many of the same functions.
