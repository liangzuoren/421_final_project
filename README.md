Rice BIOE 421 Final Project

Fitness Watch
	We have developed an affordable watch that, in addition to keeping time, functions as a pedometer which counts calories burned throughout the day. Our watch will also have a stop-watch feature to help with timed workouts. Unlike most of the pedometers on the market today, ours is capable of storing the user’s fitness data over time and displaying this information as graphs and charts on the pedometer display. This allows the user to collect information from their pedometer in an easy-to-utilize way, which can help them with their fitness goals. Data logging can better inform the user’s fitness activity, and ensure that they are recognizing the times when they are falling short. In addition, our watch utilizes a calorie counting algorithm which takes into account the user’s gender, height, and weight in order to estimate the calories burned daily, and can log this information over time as well. Most of the pedometers with data logging capability that are on the market today are very costly, so our watch would fulfill the need for a cost-efficient fitness monitor to promote public health. We utilized an Arduino Pro Mini, a small OLED display, a triple-axis accelerometer, and a data logger in order to create this low-cost device.
